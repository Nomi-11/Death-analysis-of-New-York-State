    "text": "1 Introduction\nNew York State, with its diverse and populous nature, is a microcosm of the broader United States. The patterns and trends observed in New York can provide valuable insights into the larger national picture. Suicide, alcohol-related deaths, and firearm fatalities are major contributors to mortality and have profound impacts on public health, families, and communities. Understanding their dynamics in New York can inform public health strategies both within the state and beyond. Exploring the topic of suicide and alcohol-related deaths through data analysis presents a compelling and socially significant avenue of study, one that holds immense potential for impacting public health policies, mental health awareness, and societal wellbeing at large. Suicide, as a public health crisis, carries a profound and often understated impact on communities worldwide, cutting across age, gender, race, and socio-economic boundaries. Delving into this topic is not just about understanding statistics; it’s about uncovering the hidden narratives behind these numbers, narratives that can guide interventions, shape public discourse, and lead to life-saving changes in how societies address mental health. There are several questions we are interested in exploring with further data analysis and visualization: How do suicide rates vary across different age groups, genders, and ethnicities in New York State? Has there been a significant change in the rate of suicide or alcohol-related deaths in New York State over the years? Which regions in New York State have the highest rates of suicide, alcohol-related, and firearm deaths? These questions can guide us through the following analysis of the dataset, helping to uncover critical insights and inform targeted interventions for improving public health outcomes in New York State."
